title: To Blog or Not to Blog
layout: post
---


The original intention of this blog was to serve as a place where I could
showcase the programming work I have done and detail my process. However, as
you can tell, there hasn't been any posts since my first ["Hello,
World!"](/blog/hello-world/) post. Sure, I've been working on projects, but I
just haven't gotten to the point in any of those projects where I felt like I
could blog in detail about it.

Then I watched this great talk that [Brian
Jones](http://pyvideo.org/speaker/352/brian-k-jones) gave at
[PyCon](http://pycon.org) that my friend, [Daniel Bond](http://dbond.cc/),
pointed out to me:

<div class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe width="640" height="360"

frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

One point that he makes that really resonates with me is how I should write
even if I feel like I don't know what I'm talking about. The reluctance to show
my inexperience is essentially the reason this blog sat stale for so many
months after its inception.

I have decided I will take Brian's words to heart, and start blogging just for
the sake of writing. Henceforth, I will no longer hesitate to chronicle my
journey through programming, writing, and any other quest which may take a hold
of me as I continue to improve and broaden my skills. I'll be wrong, I'll ask
questions, and I may frankly look like a blundering idiot at times; but, I only
ask that you just bear with me and understand that I'm new at all this still,
and I appreciate any constructive criticism that anyone has for me.

Let's see how far I can go.
